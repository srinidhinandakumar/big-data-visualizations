# Visualization of Big Datasets and Large scale Image Similarity

**Objective:** The goal is to build effective visualizations using d3js to make inferences from v2 UFO dataset. Further, we aim to device a method using Imagenet to find similar ufo images.

**Note:** This project is built over the previous two projects [here](https://github.com/srinidhinandakumar/big-data-ocr-ner) and [here](https://github.com/srinidhinandakumar/big-data-content-similarity)

> We have created 10 static and 2 dynamic visualizations. Dynamic visualizations fetch data from SOLR, clean and extract data in required format and render d3 viz.


### Visualizations
